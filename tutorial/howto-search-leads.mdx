Are you looking for a solution that allows integrating LinkedIn Leads into your sales process automatically? In this article, I’ll show you how to leverage our API to scrape leads from LinkedIn sales navigator searches programatically, without using your own LinkedIn account, without providing any cookies, and even without using any browser extension. All you need to provide is the search criteria.

For example, assuming you’re in need of a lead list with these criteria:

* **Job title includes**: owner, founder, or director

* **Location**: United States

* **Industry**: Software Development

* **Company headcount range**: 11-200

Below is how you can do it easily in the Python language, step by step.
<Steps>
  <Step title="Initiate a Search">
```python
import requests
import time

# Replace this with your actual API key
api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"

# API base URL
api_host = "fresh-linkedin-profile-data.p.rapidapi.com"

def initiate_search():
    url = f"https://{api_host}/search-employees"
    payload = {
        "geo_codes": [103644278],  # United States
        "title_keywords": ["Owner", "Founder", "Director"],
        "industry_codes": [4],  # Software Development
        "company_headcounts": ["11-50", "51-200"],
        "limit": 50
    }
    headers = {
        "x-rapidapi-key": api_key,
        "x-rapidapi-host": api_host,
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }

    response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
    response_data = response.json()
    print("Initiate Search Response:", response_data)
    return response_data.get("request_id")
```
