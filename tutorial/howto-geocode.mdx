## What is a geo\_code?

In LinkedIn, each location, region or country is associated with a global unique id that's called a **geo\_code** in our API. For example, the geo\_code of United States is 103644278.

## How to find it?

Simply go to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/?currentJobId=3662502499&geoId=103644278&keywords=IT&location=United%20States&refresh=true" target="_blank">LinkedIn website</a>, put in your target location (i.e United States) and you'll see the geo\_code in the address bar.
