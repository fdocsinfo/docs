## Having a big employee search? No problem, we now can scrape searches that are up to 50k results.

### üõ† How the Process Works
#### **Step 1Ô∏è‚É£: Initiate Search**
- Launch your search with specific criteria via this endpoint.
- This endpoint returns a **`request_id`**, allowing you to track progress through the [**Check Search Status**](https://fdocs.info/api-reference/endpoint/check-search-status) endpoint.
- The search initiation alone costs **50 credits**, even if the search returns **0 results**.
- Then each result costs 0.7 credits, and will be charged in advanced before you actually fetch the results.

#### **Step 2Ô∏è‚É£: Monitor Search Progress**
- Use the [**Check Search Status**](https://fdocs.info/api-reference/endpoint/check-search-status) endpoint to track your search.
- This action is **free of charge**.
#### **Step 3Ô∏è‚É£: Retrieve Results**
- Once the search is complete, access the results via the [**Get Search Results**](https://fdocs.info/api-reference/endpoint/get-search-results) endpoint.
- Fetching results is free of charge.

### This endpoint is for custom-plan users only. Please [contact us](mailto:support@fdocs.info) for more details.
