### üõ† How the Process Works
#### **Step 1Ô∏è‚É£: Initiate Search**
- Launch your search with specific criteria via this endpoint.
- This endpoint returns a **`request_id`**, allowing you to track progress through the [**Check Search Status**](https://fdocs.info/api-reference/endpoint/check-search-status) endpoint.
- This step costs minimum **50 credits**, even if the search returns **0 results** (Excluding cases where the filters you provided are invalid).
#### **Step 2Ô∏è‚É£: Monitor Search Progress**
- Use the [**Check Search Status**](https://fdocs.info/api-reference/endpoint/check-search-status) endpoint to track your search.
- This action is **free of charge**.
#### **Step 3Ô∏è‚É£: Retrieve Results**
- Once the search is complete, access the results via the [**Get Search Results**](https://fdocs.info/api-reference/endpoint/get-search-results) endpoint.
- Retrieving each result incurs **0.5 credits**. For example, fetching **1000 results** will consume **500 credits** (*not include 50 credits at **step 1***).
